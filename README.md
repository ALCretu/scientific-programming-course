Project for the 'Scientific Programming for Neuroeconomic course' 

Simple task investigating the influence of contextual cues on reaction time 

Participants observe blurred grasping pictures preceded by colored cues and have to decide which grasp type is being showed. They are instructed to respond as FAST AS POSSIBLE and they receive feedback in each trial, as soon as they press a button (the feedback consists of an emoticon appearing in the left side of the screen ':)' -> correct and ':(' -> error).
Grasps: precision grip (PG) or whole-hand grip (WHG)
Cues: white, blue and grey squares

They are instructed that two of the colors are associated with a specific grasp type:
while -> PG
blue -> WHG

In reality, this is valid in only 50% of the trials. In the other half, participants either observe these blue and white cues preceding the incorrect grasp type (25% of all trials: white -> WHG and blue -> PG) or grey cues which are neutral and are not associated with a specific grasp (25% of all trials).
